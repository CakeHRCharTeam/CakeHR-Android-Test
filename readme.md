# CakeHR Test Android App

This app makes a call to a service and populates a list, you are asked to write down on a document all the things you would change in this code, as well as any fixes and tests cases you can come up with.

You are free to fix or re-write the code if you have the will and the time, just download the code, fix it, and push it up on a pull request, we'll review what you did.
